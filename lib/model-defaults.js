/**
 * Per-model default reasoning effort overrides — the durable half of the
 * Settings page's per-model "default effort" pickers.
 *
 * The file lives at `~/.dsh/plugins/subscriptions/model-defaults.json`
 * (mode 0600, atomic replace). Shape: `{ "<provider>": { "<model id>": "<effort>" } }`.
 * An absent entry means "follow the provider's own default": the `Default`
 * chip the model picker shows when the discovered catalog advertises no
 * default at all.
 *
 * Writes are single-process and atomic, but *not* as serialised as the rest
 * of the page: the Settings page disables only the row being saved, so two
 * rows saved back to back can overlap. The write chain below serialises them,
 * so no update is lost to a read-modify-write race. Every read comes from the
 * in-memory snapshot, so the on-disk file only needs to survive a restart: a
 * malformed file reads as empty and is rewritten on the next save, never
 * taking the plugin down with it.
