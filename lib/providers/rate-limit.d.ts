/**
 * Rate-limit window handling shared by the subscription adapters.
 *
 * A subscription plan is rate-limit shaped by design — a five-hour session
 * window, a weekly window, and on some plans a per-model weekly one — so a 429
 * is not a dead end: the window reopens at a time the provider discloses. This
 * module turns that disclosure into the `providerRetryAfterMs` the optional
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-retry` plugin waits out, and resolves the retry policy
 * whose `maxDelayMs` decides how long a route is allowed to hold the turn.
 *
 * The wait itself is provider-independent: adapters own the policy, the retry
 * plugin executes it. Only the extraction of the reset instant differs, so each
 * adapter contributes one {@link RateLimitResetReader} built from the parsing
 * primitives here.
